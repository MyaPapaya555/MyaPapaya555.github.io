    <p class="about-text">
      Hello and welcome ♡ I’m Mya, a Cincinnati-based artist and Magic: The Gathering enthusiast.
      Art has always been woven into my life — from ballet and music to photography and painting.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      Magic rekindled my love for working on a tiny canvas, and card altering quickly became my
      favorite way to merge creativity with play. My main commanders are Bello, Bard of the Brambles
      and Doran, Besieged by Time.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      When I’m not painting or playing, you’ll usually find me at ballet, lifting weights,
      or spending time with my boyfriend and our cats.
    </p>
