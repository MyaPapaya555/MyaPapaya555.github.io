    Hello and welcome ♡
    I’m Mya, a Cincinnati-based artist and Magic: The Gathering enthusiast. Art has always been woven into my life — from ballet and music to photography and painting. Magic rekindled my love for working on a tiny canvas, and card altering quickly became my favorite way to merge creativity with play.
    My main commanders are Bello, Bard of the Brambles and Doran, Besieged by Time but when I’m not painting or playing, you’ll usually find me at ballet, lifting weights, or spending time with my boyfriend and our cats.
